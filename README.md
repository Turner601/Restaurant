# Restaurant

This was a mock web page that was designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The only thing that actually functions is the "About" tab at the top which opens another page and shows "about" the restaurant. The rest of it doesn't function like a normal webpage as the intent for this was to just keep practicing using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap so I could get more comfortable using it.
